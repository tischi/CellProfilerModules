## Modules

### DisplayDataAndSaveAsPdf

Current version has been tested with CellProfiler 2.1.1.

This module appears in the "Data Tools" group of the CellProfiler modules.

The module is a simple extension of the original DisplayDataOnImage module. The additional feature is that it saves the displayed image as a pdf file. The issue is that if you paint numbers in an image they might not be well visible if there are not enough pixels (this becomes relevant if you want to save an image with numbers later using "SaveImages"). The pdf format solves this problem because it handles the text as vector graphics and thus can display it with much higher resolution than the underlying image.

Note that ImageJ will __not__ display the numbers in the pdf images; so you have to open it with another viewer.
